# Module-1-Horiseon
Coding Bootcamp First Module Challenge

## Description
This is a Mock-Up webpage that was designed to simmulate On-The-Job Tickets. 
The goal of this project is to correct and add comments for both the HTML and CSS code while also uploading the code successfuly to github & detailed README file. 
I have inserted comments labeling the portions of html code. 
I have corrected the link in HTML for "serch-engine-optimization" image by adding an id="search-engine-optimization".
In CSS I have added ' ' to Calibri throughout the sheet and notes.
